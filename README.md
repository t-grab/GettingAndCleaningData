## Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This is t-grab's repository for the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course 
of the Coursera "Data Science" specialization.

Parts of the Project
====================
- UCI HAR Dataset: Dataset obtained from several experiments carried out by smartlab entitled
"Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset". This project uses Version 1.0. It contains
sensor data from smartphones carried by 30 different volunteers in different activities. For more information
see the the README.txt in the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder.

- CodeBook.md: Contains descriptions of the variables, the data and transformations applied to the 
data by the script "run_analysis.R" to create the tidy datset.

- run_analysis.R: R script to perform the transmations on the UCI HAR dataset to create the tidy dataset

- tidyDataSet.*: Tidy dataset created by "run_analysis.R" in different formats

- README.md
